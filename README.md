This was my first project I did in my life, I really wanted to thank the people who helped me on my learning path who really helped me when I needed it, which are my friends Rizzex and DontCry361x, you were very important to me and I'm publishing this so that other people can understand that it's not as complicated as you think, the beginning can be difficult but once you learn you won't forget it, anyway, that's what you can enjoy! (don't judge me if you find some stolen things because there is no one who learns things without having contact with them in practice)
